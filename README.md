# Folium Notebooks

Trying out interactive map visualization using Folium and Geopandas. Useful if you have geographical information in your dataset that you would like to visualize; points, lines, polygons, chloropleth maps. All sorts of things.

Here's a picture of cafes in Kansai, coloured according to their proximity to the center of Kyoto. I'm putting this here because you can't view the interactive maps through the github viewer.
