# Folium Notebooks

Trying out interactive map visualization using Folium and Geopandas. Useful if you have geographical information in your dataset that you would like to visualize; points, lines, polygons, chloropleth maps. All sorts of things.

Here's a picture of cafes in Kansai, coloured according to their proximity to the center of Kyoto. I'm putting this here because you can't view the interactive maps through the github viewer.

You can view the maps in nbviewer however, so here are links for each of the notebooks.
